# Project TODOs

1. [√] Implement and test distributed agent(agent_distributed.py)

2. [ ] Implement and test diffusion stochastic MuZero
   - [ ] Add diffusion model components(Rectified Flow)
   - [ ] Realize Stochastic MuZero(refer to mctx.stochastic_muzero_policy)
   - [ ] Implement sampled MuZero mechanism

3. [ ] Implement and test learning MCTS as policy improvement

4. [ ] Environments: 
   - [√] Open spiel Game Go
   - [ ] Atari 100k
   - [ ] dm_control
   - [ ] safety (review)

5. [ ] Experiment with different search policies
   - [ ] on open spiel game Go
   - [ ] on stochastic Multi-Arm Bandits
   - [ ] implement ltr with similar processing as AlphaZero
   - [ ] find out equation equivalent for ltr 
   

## Notes
- Each implementation should include comprehensive testing
